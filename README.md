# What is it?

The CLI is part of the **makeUp** framework. It makes no sense using it without the framework! 
You can download **makeUp** here: https://github.com/dahas/makeup2

After downloading you can run <code>npm install</code>. This will install the CLI. Now you can do several things with the framework using the CLI.
